Feel free to improve this app! You can open an issue [here](../../issues) or make a pull request.

The app already supports all the languages in android for displaying the dates;
you can help by translating the strings for the settings menu, by letting me know
what all the phrases/words in the file [strings.txt](./strings.txt) should be in your language!
